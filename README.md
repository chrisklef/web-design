Report: 

The development of the website was inspired by non-fungible tokens (NFT). A non-fungible token is a digital asset that, like the Charlie Bit My Finger video that sold for Â£500,000 back in May, symbolizes a real-world object. NFTs are typically encoded with the same underlying software as various cryptocurrencies and are bought and traded online, often with cryptocurrency. (Conti, 2022). The website consists of Five pages Home, About, Gallery, Contacts, FAQs Page and styles page

<ul>:Represents an unordered list, which is typically used for navigation menus, items list, etc. 

<li>:Defines a list item and is always used within a list container  

<main>:Specifies the main content of the documents, which is unique to the documents and stands out for accessibility tools 

<section>;Defines a section in a document, usually with a thematic grouping of content, which often include a heading

<footer>:Represents the footer of a document or a section, typically containing authorship information, copyright notices, or related documents  

 

HTML BREAKDOWN 

icon: 
width: Sets the width of the element to 150 pixels. 
height: Sets the height to auto, which means the element's height will scale proportionally to its width. 
display: Changes the display behavior to block, making it a block-level element. 
margin: Sets all margins to 0. 
position: Defines the positioning context as absolute, which is positioned relative to its first positioned ancestor element. 
top: Positions the top edge of the element at 0 pixels from the top edge of its containing block. 
left: Positions the left edge of the element at 5 pixels from the left edge of its containing block. 
.social icons: 
Not defined in the provided snippet, but given the name, it's likely intended to style the container that holds social media icons. 
.art-piece: 
text-align: Aligns the text to the center of the element. 
img: This is not a class but a descendant selector that styles imp elements inside .art-piece. It sets the width to 100% of the containing element and the height to auto, maintaining the aspect ratio of the image. 
.contact-form: 
max-width: Sets the maximum width of the element to 600 pixels, which means it can be smaller but not wider than 600 pixels. 
margin: Centers the element within its container by setting auto margins on the left and right. 
.gallery: 
display: Implements a flex container to enable the flexible box layout on its children. 
flex-wrap: Allows the flex items to wrap onto multiple lines. 
justify-content: Centers the flex items along the main axis of the container. 
.content, .image, .news, .artwork, .contact-form, and other classes are mentioned but not explicitly defined in the CSS snippet you provided. However, based on their names, we can infer their potential uses: 
.content: Likely used for the main textual content of the website, possibly including paragraphs and articles. 
.image: Could be used for styling image containers, possibly influencing dimensions, borders, or positioning. 
.news: Might be associated with a section displaying the latest news or updates, formatting the layout or typography for news articles. 
.artwork: Potentially styles individual pieces of artwork within the gallery, affecting presentation and layout. 
.contact-form: Styles the form used for visitors to send messages, impacting the form fields, labels, and the submit button. 
Without the full CSS definitions for these classes, the exact characteristics cannot be determined. However, class names typically reflect their purpose or the elements they style, and the provided snippet suggests a focus on layout control, media responsiveness, and aesthetic design consistent with a gallery-focused website. 

 

 

POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT 

There is a few developments that could be applied to the code making it close to perfection like adding an interactive gallery, implementing JavaScript or a JavaScript library creating an interactive and dynamic gallery where users can click on NFTs to view more details or purchase them 

User account systems 

`Develop a user registration and login system to allow users to manage their purchases and interact with the community  

Provide user profiles where users can display their NFT collections  

Advance search and filters: 

Implement search functionality with filters based on price, popularity, and new arrivals to help users find specific NFTs 

Responsive Web Design Enhancement: 

User CSS framework like Bootstrap or Foundation to ensure the website is fully responsive and mobile-friendly across all devices  

These potential development aim to make the website more engaging, functional, secure, and accessible. Ultimately providing a better platform for showcasing and trading NFTs
